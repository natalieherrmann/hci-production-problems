## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13G0u0kgrl70r++81yMngcpvZ00
Your Rationale: I chose a monochromatic set of a less saturated, close to grey
blue since a set these colors feel more sleek, and video game consoles in recent
years have tried to look more sleek. Blue is a calming color that isn't too
overpowering, which should make it easy to be around for a long time as you're
playing video games.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52n0K0kl7J500++bvUjulyhDff6
Your Rationale: Green feels like the color most indicative of springtime, and a
color representative of gardens and nature, so I wanted green to be the main
color. I choose bright, medium saturated shades since spring is bright and full
of life. The colors are medium saturated as opposed to highly saturated to feel
more professional. I included a close cyan and yellow as adjacent colors because
a deep blue or orange don't feel very evocative as spring.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33x0R0kIm++erYEq6+F+zCSVwlm
Your Rationale: This triadic set contains primary colors to feel simple and
welcoming, and resemble colors of the average fridge magnet alphabet set. The
colors are bright and highly saturated since they feel more child-friendly than
muted, dark colors. The hue of each of the color is lighter than its pure form
to feel more playful.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=c3m3h07181kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFk4fGJ0aZb1CRm7WvGcNqQkllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFk3e4p3rjm3jcAb83qig3H
Your Rationale: Blue is often associated with cyber/digital things so I have a
blue-teal as the main color. Since cybersecurity relates to protection, I have a
contrasting red-orange to represent locks. I have more neutral dark and light
grey to tie the scheme together and give it a more professional feel. The light
grey has a hint of teal to connect it to the main color.
