## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
Use an accent color (a blue they use on their homepage) to make it clear what form elements are clickable. Interactive elements should be a different color from non-interactive text so it's immediately clear what you can and should click. In sketch_color_type.png, the drop down and text entry at the bottom are outlined in blue to distinguish it from the black text; the price/donation entry is black since it autofills and cannot be interacted with. In sketch_input.png, the price/donation entry is outlined in blue since it can be interacted with.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
The text for "Benefits for x Members include:" before the bulleted list is now bigger and bolded since information about a particular membership is important and the start of the section should be more emphasized.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
