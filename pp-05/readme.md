## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. http://drpete.co/?topic=25-point-website-usability-checklist  
2. https://teamsuccess.io/UX  

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. First impression: pages are easily digestible upon first impression.
2. Consistency: pages are cohesive and have a consistent design.
3. Clear & descriptive headings: headings make it clear what purpose of the page / content below is.
4. Links, buttons and checkboxes are easily recognizable: there is contrast between elements that can and cannot be interacted with.
5. Links, buttons and checkboxes are usable: elements that can be interacted with can easily be clicked or navigated with the keyboard.
6. Clear call for action: buttons and links make it clear what the action is / what comes next.
7. Simplicity: only necessary information is asked for.
8. Visible, relevant error messages: error messages are clear and are shown near the element they relate to.
9. Responsiveness: the layout works at different screen sizes.
10. Reasonable Site Load-time
